# SKAdNetworkIdentifierHelper
Easily extract/import SKAdNetworkIdentifiers into property list format

This tool contains two options: list to plist, and plist to list. As you may guess, it can convert a list of SKAdNetworkIdentifiers to property list format, and also extract a list of SKAdNetworkIdentifiers from the corresponding property list format.

Per https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/663032 this tool will also convert all of the identifiers to lowercase and will sort them too.
